# SuperJS
A very simple for-fun project to play with imperative JavaScript capabilities.

## About this project
This is just a very simple implementation of data binding and routing using native javascript capabilities such as document fragments, this project is nothing more than just a test for fun, however, it is open source so feel free to fork it anytime and make what you want of it

### How does it work?
This project manages navigation by emptying the navigable div's innerHtml and filling it with a newly created document fragment, these document fragments are builts using normal JavaScript methods, however there are functions that abstract and simplify the creation of text and text input tags

To simplify the process of developing the website a few things are just static html such as the aside navbar. Another thing I do is to basically not use classes and instead do css drilling to the components I need to style, this also helps the CSS to be more organized

### What else?
I plan on adding support for navigation using the browser history api, this means that the url will change when navigating to pages and you will be able to reload to the page you were in previously
I also plan on making updated to the CSS so the webpage displays nicely in mobile devices... And I want to do refactor on a lot of code too :P
